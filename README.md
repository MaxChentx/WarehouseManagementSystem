# WarehouseManagementSystem
Developed in pure Java language for coursework this semester, in my opinion,it's a quite boring project,but if you want to finish it with a perfect end, it's also a challenge.
Although, it is a very basic projectï¼Œbut there are also profound principles that apply to the vast majority of future projects.

### MySQL database
### Java Swing
### Maven
